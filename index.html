      On March 11th the world health organization declared the coronavirus (COVID-19)  a world wide pandemic. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
      is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus
      </p>
      <p>
      “Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory 
      illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying 
      medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are 
      more likely to develop serious illness.” 
      - World Health Organization.

       With this the growing concern of how to mitigate the damage from COVID-19 I decided to do some
        research which because of the rapid changing news  led  me into a lot of different directions. 
        One direction in particular caught my attention, and that was the vulnerability of the 
        prison population. <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/podcasts/public-health-on-call/">Coronavirus effects on human 
        rights podcast</a> March 19th, episode) In this podcast they talked about how 
        there may be a problem when it come to protecting people in prisons from catching and transmitting the virus, because they 
        are unable to take the same precautions that the rest of the population can i.e. social distancing.

      The United States has the largest prison population in the world. 
       Around the world cities, and even countries have wrestled with what to do to prevent this particular 
        population from being  so negatively affected.  Besides the United States there are three countries 
        in particular that have had different approaches and consequences when it comes to inmates and 
        protection from COVID-19 these include Brazil, Italy, and Iran.

      Brazil is a country that also has a very large prison population. On March 16th
       hundreds of prisons were not allowed to leave the semi-open facility for easter prison holidays
        were canceled and visitor restrictions were tightened.

      <p>
      Similar to Brazil Italy has seen riots and escapes of prisoners  due to fear of coronavirus. 
      The Italian government adopted a decree to allow prisons with less than 18 months on their sentences 
      to have early release. This unfortunately was not enough because in early march  50 prisons in italy 
      experienced riots due to anxiety and restrictions placed by prison authorities. In addition to these
       restrictions there have been measures taken to provide prisons and guards with mask, 
       gloves, and temperature checks.

        In early march Iran confirmed that they would temporarily free 54,000 prisoners in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19. At this time Iran was the largest location of new cases outside of China.
