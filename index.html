    On March 11th the world health organization declared the coronavirus (COVID-19)  
    a world wide pandemic. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
    is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

      “Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory 
      illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying 
      medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are 
      more likely to develop serious illness.” 
      - World Health Organization.

        Covid-19 is now a normal part of life for all of us her in the United States. 
        As a country we have taken steps to mitigate the damage from COVID-19, like social distancing, 
        more routine hand washing, and wearing of mask in public spaces. 
        Not to mention the unprecedented buying of toilet paper and  hand sanitizer.

        Earlier this year I decided to do some research on the virus which because of the rapid changing news led  me into a lot of different directions.  
        My attention was caught when I started to read and listen to podcast talking about vulnerability of prison populations to infectious deceases.

       <sub><i>(clarification <b>jail</b> can be used to describe a place for those awaiting trial or held for minor crimes,
        whereas <b>prison</b> describes a place for convicted criminals of serious crimes.)</i></sub>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
        In this podcast the host talked about how prison and jail  populations can be particularly effected by a virus like COVID-19. 
        It is nearly impossible to prevent the spread of the virus n these locations, because of the close living quarters.  
        This makes taking the same precautions much harder especially when the population on the prison or jail is large.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The United States has the largest prison population in the world. 
        Around the world cities, and even countries have wrestled with what to do to prevent the spread of the virus in  prisons.
         Three countries took action early on in the global pandemic to lower the population size of these facilities, and the USA has taken note from their actions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Iran, Brazil, Italy,
        With the constant changing numbers in early March Iran was the largest location of new cases outside of China. 
        Iran also confirmed that they would temporarily free 54,000 prisoners in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19. 
        A quick response to the growing number of COVID-19 cases. Iran has already released  80,000 prisoners.

        Brazil has the fourth largest prison population in the world. On March 16th
        hundreds of prisons were not allowed to leave the semi-open facility for  easter prison holidays.
         During this time visitor restrictions were tightened also. This lead to riots in prisons facilities and hundreds of prisoners escaping  from semi-open prisons in São Paulo state in the south-east of Brazil. 
        With the over crowding of the Brazilian prison there is a very real fear of spread of COVI-19.

      <section>
        Italy being one of the most effected countries in the early parts of the pandemic they have had their share of problems dealing with COVID-19.
        Similar to Brazil,  Italy has seen riots and escapes of prisoners due to fear of coronavirus. 
        The Italian government adopted a decree to allow prisons with less than 18 months on their sentences to have early release. 
        This unfortunately was not enough because in early march  50 prisons in Italy experienced riots due to anxiety and restrictions placed by prison authorities. 
        In addition to these restrictions there have been measures taken to provide prisons and guards with mask, 
        gloves, and temperature checks. <sub>(March 2020)</sub>

        These examples are only a few  of prisoner releases around the globe in an attempt to stem the spread of COVID-19. As of late March the United States has started to release prisoners from cities around the  country following in the path of Iran.
        <a href= “https://www.prisonpolicy.org/virus/virusresponse.html">Prison response in the USA</a>

          <ul>
            <li>In Hawaii, 655 people have been released early from state prisons and the statewide jail population has dropped about 37% since early March. </li>
            <li>In Los Angeles County, CA, the jail population has decreased by about 30% since early March. (See jail releases section.)</li>
            <li>Only three states have not suspended medical co-pays for people in state prisons: Nevada, Hawaii, and Delaware. (See medical co-pays section.)</li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        According to the <a href=“https://www.prisonpolicy.org/virus/virusresponse.html">PrisonPolicy website</a> 
        the united states some jails are making the necessary changes to their population size to help curb the  possible spread of the virus. 
        Unfortunately most prisons are not releasing many  prisoners when compared to the local jails. 
        The with possible second wave the of infections as a country we need to be prepared continue to reduce the risk in any way we can.
